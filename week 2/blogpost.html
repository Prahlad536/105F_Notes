        <h2>Welcome To My Blog</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my small blog website. I created this page while learning web development to share my thoughts and ideas. 
            In this blog, Iâ€™ll write about technology, daily life experiences, and the things Iâ€™m learning along the way. 
            Building this site has helped me understand how HTML works â€” from headings and paragraphs to images and links. 
            I hope you enjoy reading my posts and feel inspired to start learning web development too!

        <h2>My Learning Experiences</h2>
        <p>I always wanted to know how websites are built and how they work behind the scenes. After learning basic HTML, I realized that creating web pages isnâ€™t as hard as it looks â€” itâ€™s actually fun! 
            Iâ€™m also learing CSS , so I can make my website look more colorful and responsive. 
            My goal is to become a full-stack developer one day and build useful websites for people in Nepal and around the world.
